Implementation of the article - Molecular Communications: Model-Based and Data-Driven Receiver Design and Optimization by XUEWEN QIAN1, MARCO DI RENZO, and ANDREW ECKFORD

## Summary 

In this paper, we consider a molecular communication system that is made of a 3D unbounded diffusion channel model without flow, a point transmitter, and a spherical absorbing receiver. We studied the impact of ISI and reproduced results of various threshold based receiver schemes mentioned in the paper. The aim of this was to show that ANN models can generate equivalent performance like that of model based approaches without requiring any prior knowledge of the system model. Furthermore, we extended our research to apply LSTM models on the molecular system which gave even better accuracy than the ANN models. Moreover, we did literature review on vesicle based propagation, channel impulse response for passive receiver and enzymatic degradation.
